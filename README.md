<h2> Hi, nice to mee you! I'm  Sofia. 👋 </h2>

I’m a *multidisciplinary* **graphic designer** based in Berlin 🇩🇪🇦🇷. <br>
Right now, I’m diving into web development with the Web Dev Bootcamp by Neue Fische! 🐠

Skills I've learned so far:

```HTML / CSS``` ```Javascript``` ```React```  ```Next.js``` ```MongoDB``` 

I love combining design and code to bring innovative projects to life. Let's talk tech! ;)
