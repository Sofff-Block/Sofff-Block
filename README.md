<h2> Hi, I'm  Sofia. 👋 </h2>

Nice to meet you! <br>
I’m a *multidisciplinary* **graphic designer** based in Berlin. From Hamburg 🇩🇪 / Buenos Aires🇦🇷. <br>
Right now, I’m diving into web development with the Web Dev Bootcamp by Neue Fische! 🐠

Skills I've learned so far:

```HTML``` ```CSS``` ```Javascript``` ```React```  ```Next.js``` ```MongoDB``` 

I love combining design and code to bring innovative projects to life. Let's talk tech!😉
